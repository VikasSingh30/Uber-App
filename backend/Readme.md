2️⃣ Middleware (middleware.js) → Validates/authenticates the request before it reaches the controller.
3️⃣ Controller (controller.js) → Processes the request and calls the appropriate service.
4️⃣ Service (service.js) → Contains business logic and interacts with models.
5️⃣ Models (models.js) → Connects to the database and fetches/stores data.
6️⃣ Response is sent back to the client.
